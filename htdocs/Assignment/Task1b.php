        <p>JavaScript and PHP are very similar languages as they run scripts and perform
          functions using programming methods and techniques such as if statements. The
          difference being JavaScript is used on the client side end of a web page and PHP
          is a server side language. The difference between these is client side scripting
          is where all functions and scripts are run from the client’s browser, which has
          its benefits and limitations, and server side is all run remotely on a server
          instead which also has its benefits and limitations</p>
        <h2>What Can Be Developed</h2>
				<p>Many things can be developed using both languages as they are capable of many
          different functions and can achieve many tasks. With server side scripting, you can
          make them more interactive and increase efficiency as all the functions run off the
          server and not the client’s browser and PC. They used for functions on
          a website such as useful such as browser detection, cookies and user information
          validation. These are very useful for keeping data secure and using it for analytical
          purposes such as what browser is most used, how much of the people viewing the website
          are male or female or what age range is the clients using the website, and making sure
          no false data is inputted.</p>
				<h2>The Benefits Of Using One Over Another</h2>
				<p>The benefit of using PHP over JavaScript is that all data and all functions are run
          remotely from a web server, instead of a client’s PC. All data can be securely stored
          in a database and can only be accessed by the client from the website and is not stored
          on their PC’s. Furthermore, all functions are run through the server, meaning the capabilities
          of the client’s browser or PC is not an issue when performing tasks. This helps make your
          website widely accessible through many devices. Although the time taken for the function to
          work is now based on how long it takes to retrieve that information form the server, so internet
          speed is a key issue.</p>
				<h2>The Drawbacks Of Using One Over Another</h2>
				<p>JavaScript’s main drawback is the fact it’s client side. This means any information needed such
          as account details or details of an order for example can only be accessed on that client’s PC.
          This isn’t helpful to anyone who needs the information from a different location like the website
          owner, and anyone who accesses this PC whether it be through hacking or physically going onto the
          device can access all this information without any encryption or encoding protecting it. Also, all
          the script for the website is dependent on the performance of the client’s device they’re using, so
          load times could be longer for some users, discouraging them to continue using the website and if all
          script is stored in the HTML to avoid needing a separate .js file then code executions would take longer
          and code would lose its readability.</p>
